            <h1>Apple</h1>
            <p>I am definitely an Apple fanboy. Although I do find their products quite expensive, to me, it's worth it for the quality. Because
                I love to do creative work, I thrive when I get to use Apple's products. I have a Macbook Pro, iPhone, Apple Watch, and AirPods just to name a few.
