            <h1>My Fiance</h1>
            <p>I met my fiance, Moriah Lalman, my freshman year of college. At the time, aside from serving on the same bus route, we barely talked to each
                other. In fact, we did not not begin dating till the Spring of 2021. It was her last semester of senior year, and I techincally had a semester
            left to finish. God really worked out everything in His timing and on January 30, 2022, I proposed to her. She said "yes!"</p>
