        <h1>My Bus Route</h1>
        <p>I have the privelege of being the bus captain for Route C2 at GSBC. I became a worker on this route my freshman year of college, and
            as I was entering my junior year, I was appointed bus captain. It has been one of the greatest experiences of my colleg career. I get to work
            with great people and we have the opportunity to serve the Lord together every weekend.
