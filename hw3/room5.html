            <h1>My Energy Drinks</h1>
            <p>I have hobby (some would call it an addiction) of drinking energy drinks. Due to the lack of sleep I get, I need some fuel to keep me going.
                Energy drinks typically do the job. In fact, I am currently drinking one as I type this. I have tried many brands and flavors, however, my
                favorite ones are Bang Energy, Reign, Celsius, Ghost Energy, and GFUEL.
